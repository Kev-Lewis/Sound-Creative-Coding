# Sound - (Creative Coding)
-------------------------------------------
Instructions:

First you have to click on the canvas or else it might not work correctly.

There are 4 scenes, press LEFT arrow key to start at the 1st scene or
press RIGHT arrow key to start on the 4th scene. Pressing LEFT and RIGHT arrow
keys will cycle through the 4 scenes.

Pressing UP and DOWN arrow keys will lower or raise the amp value of the
songs.

Clicking on the screen will play the sound effect for that scene.

-------------------------------------------
Description:

These scenes was made from one of my favorite games of all time Umineko:
When They Cry, so for each scene I added 3 different items. 

1: A single track of the background music from the game files.

2: A sound effect that somewhat relates to the scene from
the game files.

3: A screenshot from the game that represents the scene.

These 4 songs are some of my favorite songs from the game, so I wanted to
create a simple scene that would represent these songs, because there are so many songs in
this game that I can just listen to and visually picture a specific scene or type of
moment from the game.
